        <ul>
            <li>Early Foundations<br><br>Ndaedzoni Palace's vision traces its roots to the mid-21st century, when a group of visionary engineers, tech entrepreneurs, and environmentalists, (who called themselves Ndaedzonic Team) saw the potential of the land nestled at the crossroads of northern South Africa, eastern Botswana, southern Zimbabwe, and Mozambique. These leaders wanted to create a city that was not only a hub of technological innovation but also a beacon of sustainability and African excellence. They envisioned a smart city built on renewable energy, advanced infrastructure, and cutting-edge technology.<br><br></li>
            <li>The Beginning: A Technological Revolution (2018-2035)<br><br>In 2018, the idea for Ndaedzoni Palace began to take shape. The Ndaedzonic Team, working alongside multinational tech companies, agreed to support the creation of this city. Initial plans centered around the establishment of a technological park that would foster research and development in artificial intelligence, robotics, biotechnology, and clean energy.<br>Construction of the city is bound to begin in 2029, strategically placed to connect multiple African nations through a dense network of transportation infrastructure, including hyperloop systems, autonomous vehicles, and drone delivery services. The project will be powered by solar farms, wind turbines, and hydroelectric plants, making the city one of the few in the world to operate on 100% renewable energy.<br><br></li>
            <li>Rising Influence and Global Tech Hub (2030-2040)<br><br>By 2030, Ndaedzoni Palace will rapidly grow from a small tech park to a sprawling metropolis. As global demand for tech innovation and sustainability solutions increased, companies from around the world will be interested in building in Ndaedzoni Palace to take part in groundbreaking projects.<br>The city will be a magnet for talent, attracting some of the brightest minds in the world, including scientists, engineers, programmers, and entrepreneurs. The local government will set up collaborative spaces and incubators to support startups, which will result in an explosion of new tech companies and ideas. Many of these startups will be focused on solving problems unique to Africa, such as water scarcity, food security, and sustainable urban living.<br><br></li>
            <li>Cultural Integration and Innovation (2049-2060)<br><br>As Ndaedzoni Palace matures into a global center for innovation, it will maintain its cultural roots. The city’s population, diverse in its ethnic and national backgrounds, will come together to form a unique blend of traditions and futuristic thinking. Traditional African cultural elements will be celebrated through art, music, and festivals, and these will be harmoniously integrated with the city’s modern, high-tech environment.<br>At the same time, Ndaedzoni Palace will be known for its “innovative citizenship program,” where residents from across the world could participate in a collaborative effort to solve global challenges. This initiative will foster international partnerships, bringing together experts from industries ranging from tech to agriculture to healthcare. The city’s educational institutions will become globally renowned, offering cutting-edge courses in robotics, environmental science, and the arts.<br></li>
            <li>The Next Chapter: A Global Vision (2060 and Beyond)<br><br>As we enter the late 21st century, Ndaedzoni Palace will continue to evolve and set new standards for the world. With the foundation of a powerful tech economy, it will now be a critical hub for Africa’s growing influence in the global tech scene. The city will be leading the research into sustainable energy, smart cities, and blockchain technologies. It will be a key player in the global effort to address climate change, inequality, and access to digital resources.<br>Ndaedzoni Palace’s leadership will be instrumental in regional diplomacy, fostering collaboration between the four nations—South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique—in areas of infrastructure, trade, and security, making the city the symbol of unity, innovation, and progress for the African continent.<br><br></li>
